### 1. Introduction
#### 1.2 Chapter Overview
This chapter gives an introduction to the project by the problems solved by NSU Club Aggregator, the main objectives that we solved this problem through a dynamic web application.
#### 1.2 The Problem
This is the problem we are trying to solve: Some NSU clubs have different website. There is no login option of their website. And there was no common platform for all clubs, where Student can see upcoming events, running events or get notification/message by their own club authority. Most of them are static website. Static website contains information that does not change. It remains the same, or static, for every viewer of the site. But a dynamic website contains information that changes, depending on the viewer, the time of the day, the time zone, the viewer's native language, and other factors. Even most of the clubs don’t have their own website. For the reasons they cannot do any job by their website and no student can get message or notification from the club. Also, club authority has to maintain their club by manual meeting. They don’t have any database to keep their data, student information or event handling power. Nobody knows about their events but some of them who are touch with their clubs. So, it is very hard for NSU club members to get notified by their own club. Also this is hard for NSU club authority to handle the club programs and members.

#### 1.3Project Objective    
Some NSU clubs have different websites but we opened one website for all NSU students. They can login to our website. All club’s members can include their information in the website. They can get messages, do chatting, get events updates, and get notifications or any information through our website. Our website will have a database where every data will be stored. We will store all members’ information, all events information and the information of recruitments. All students can recruit any club via our website. Our website will be a platform where everyone visits and collect all type information. Also, club authority can buy package for their club. We will have some packages. We will allow few facilities for the free. Package holders’ get more facilities. We have a signup page where everyone allowed signing up. And login page for them who are already the member of the club. We frequently update every club event in our page. The top events will be highlight in the top of our pages. Every pro club authority has an option to buy a package from us to highlight their feature in our main page. Our website has different view version for mobile, personal computer, laptop and tablet. The website will also be allowed for large screen display. And we will create a chat room for club members where everyone could chat with their club members.
